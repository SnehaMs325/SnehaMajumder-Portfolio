🌌 Personal Portfolio – Sneha Majumder

A cosmic-themed personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
This project is part of my learning journey, where I explore frontend development through vibe coding, iteration, and design experimentation.

🚀 About the Project

This portfolio represents:

My current skill set and areas I’m exploring.

A space where I experiment with UI/UX concepts, animations, and component structures.

A live learning project, updated as I grow my technical abilities.

I built this project by combining self-learning, prompt-driven development, and hands-on coding — refining it step by step.
